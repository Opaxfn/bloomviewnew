you are watching this, you are likely a founder, C level executives, or a sales leader at a B2B SaaS or an agency.\n\nYou are most probably looking for ways to increase the number of meetings in your team's agenda or in yours. The goal of this video is to show you the call outbound framework we have used to generate around four hundred sixty meetings in the past ninety days by leveraging the latest sales software. And how we can do it for you too. Our clients range from HR software, upsaaS B2B professional events all the way to leading industry newsletters coaching programs, prop tech companies, recruitment firms, and marketing agencies. As you'll understand, this can work across a wide range of offers and industries.\n\nAs long as you are selling into B2B with a high enough average customer value. And yes, there is a method to the bad debts. Let's dive in.\n\nThe first thing we'll do once you sign a contract is that we'll send you a very extensive onboarding form. We'll go deep into who we should reach out to and why. We'll ask you some questions such as what do your top ten customers have in common was the one thing you could find about your potential customer that would make them a great fit for your offering. If you had unlimited time to study a prospect, What would you research about them?\n\nWhat was your ideal customer going through when they decided to reach out to you? The reason we are doing that is that we don't want to hard pitch features. We want to find out what kind of organization is suffering the most from the problem we solve so that we can present your services as the solution. Let me give you an example of our own agents.\n\nI know talking through a lot of prospective client that if a company is landing in spam, it's very likely that call email campaigns don't work. I can check for that by looking at their email configuration and looking at the existence of what we called a DMR quicker. I also know that if they are having sales development representatives or videos, there is a high chance that they are ramping up, their outbound sales reform. I can scrape job boards and LinkedIn to find out about this data.\n\nEither using a specific multimedia software, I know they are paying too much for their sales tax. Some tools such as Build Treat, let me find out the software companies are using. Finally, if they have been funded between six to twelve months ago, I know they are likely under pressure to form as they will need to showcase strong metrics for their next underground. Once again, using the tools at my disposal, I'll find out if a company was funded recently, and how recently that was.\n\nIn the end, I'm left with a list of companies that fit some or even better, all four of these real. What I know is that for most of these companies, there is a buying intent. Meaning, they're trying to make other work and they're trying to make it work. Now.\n\nBut most importantly, there is a pain I can solve. They could save money by switching tools, but also they could improve their metrics overnight by fixing their availability. When I reach out to these companies, I don't need to brag about being the best sales prospecting agency in their own. I simply need to show them that can easily get better results from their outbound efforts.\n\nOnce I effectively showcase that, they'll trust me a lot more, and some will be interested in hearing about my services If you have a business that's serving a problem in the market, we can apply the exact same methodology to find best fit companies. The last piece of the targeting puzzle is to find out who, which in our target companies we should reach out to. A simple question we'd like to ask is, who in the company is most likely to be fired if the initiative doesn't work, or you could flip the script and ask the opposite, who will be promoted if the initiative was a success.\n\nThe next part, once we figure out targeting, that we will build the sending infrastructure to make sure that your messages are received by your recipients. We typically send campaigns via cold email outbound, LinkedIn automation or both. When it comes to cold emails, Linding in the primary inbox is half of the battle. For this, the first thing you want to do is to stop sending from your main domain.\n\nIf you do that too often, this can seriously compromise your durability. This means that the email you send to your clients, partners and other important communication will land in spam never to be seen. To avoid that, we sent up ten secondary domains to which we attached two mailboxes. We warm up these new mailboxes for two weeks before sending even one sales email.\n\nWe send our emails from twenty different mailboxes, and limit our sending to fifty emails per day per mailbox. This ensures you can reach a certain volume while our deliverability stays top notch, and over seventy percent of the email we send how often.\n\nWhile you're doing the warm up for an email, and our working in account, we will build our prospect lists and write the copywriting for the messages. There are some general guidelines to follow when crafting your sales emails. You should feel free to bend and break them as you will because this is in my opinion more ours than science. What you usually want is you want your mails to be as short and concise as possible.\n\nDon't say something in twenty words if you can say it in six. You want them to include social proof show why they should listen to you. For example, by mentioning similar companies you've helped solve the very problem you are pitching. You want the messages to be personalized to the You want them to think and to feel that the message could have been sent to them and only to them.\n\nEven more important, you want each of your message to be relevant.\n\nThis usually stems from the deep research we've made prior. You know you are reaching out to them because you identified some of their priority initiatives. You can help with, and this will show in your message. Last but not least, you want your emails to be valuable.\n\nTry to give before you ask. Most emails ask for something from the prospect. For example, thirty minutes of their time. Let's fill the script.\n\nOr if you could give them something that email, that even if they decided to enroll you, they would still gain value from you. An example for a campaign we've done is we had that you recoup an agency's generic leads and very large So what we did is we wrote a guide in which we compiled all the learnings from these campaigns, and we simply shared them to all the recruitment agencies we could find. Instead of asking for time, asked them if they wanted our guide, which ultimately got us even more meetings without asking because I didn't want it to get more information on our services. A good question to ask yourself.\n\nIs what is something you can already give to your prospects for free? Something that would help them that would solve one of their biggest issue. When you do this, your number of replies is scan rockets. A nice way to put it is to ask yourself.\n\nWhat could you give for free to your prospects that they would be willing to pay for?\n\nAt this point, We know the companies will be reaching out to. We know the people within these companies will contact.\n\nWe know the mediums will use. Whether it's single automation or even automation, and we have built the infrastructure, and we have written the angle of the messages. We will reach them with. All that's left is to set everything up in our cold email sending automation tool or in our LinkedIn automation tool, and we are ready go.\n\nAnd this is where you come in. We build the service in the objective of making it as a hands off to you as possible. Don't get this wrong. We won't have your valuable inputs to guide the strategy of the campaigns.\n\nBut the idea is to free up most of your team's prospecting time so that they can focus on what brings revenue closing things. And what we do for that, our inbox managers are scheming all replies we get from the campaigns. Every time it leads response positively, that is They're requesting for more information. They tell you they're interested or they want to book a meeting straight away.\n\nYou'd be notified.\n\nEither through a slack notification or via email. This is where we do the hand off, and that's good time for you and your safe If you are interested in getting more information about how we helped Lars. See you at digital people close eight clients and four hundred dollars on worth of deals for his recruitment firms, or how we head Brian from the right puzzle, generate sign ups and add monthly recurring revenue to his newly launched obsessed, or even how we had Fabiano at Harorpe pioneers, sell out of sponsorships for his B2B industry events and how we help Nicholas at Curus and Partners close fifteen deals from cold email for half a million plus how we are continuously filling out our own agenda with meetings. Feel free to schedule a thirty minute meeting with us, and we'll discuss your outbound initiatives."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"6dedd4","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"videoThumbnail":{"on":"true","hashedId":"ow2y75tvjk","trimStart":"131.21","trimEnd":"136.21","async":"false","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}},"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"true","roundedPlayer":"6","showCustomerLogo":"false","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/5100fa3dd498d729ebde377bea725962.png","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/65ee306cc4bf16cf9b586d35d139c6d6.png","width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"6dedd4","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"videoThumbnail":{"on":"true","hashedId":"ow2y75tvjk","trimStart":"131.21","trimEnd":"136.21","async":"false","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}},"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"true","roundedPlayer":"6","showCustomerLogo":"false","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/5100fa3dd498d729ebde377bea725962.png","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/65ee306cc4bf16cf9b586d35d139c6d6.png","width":"1920","height":"1080"}}},"options":{}};
