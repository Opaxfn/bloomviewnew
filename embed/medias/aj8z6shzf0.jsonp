In the next few minutes, I will show you how we generate five to twenty leads per week for our clients by leveraging AI and data testing software and how you can learn how to do this too. So who is this for? This is for, one, startup founders who want to build their go to market motion from scratch. Two, this is for sales leaders who want to make their team more efficient by equipping them with better tools and strategy.\n\nAnd three, it is for bidders, sales development representatives, and outbound agencies that want to learn how they can leverage AI to generate opportunities. And let me tell you what. There is an increasing number of active jobs opening for a new kind of role within organizations that mix sales tech, AI, automation, and prospecting knowledge. Some call it the SEO for sales development operator, the growth BDR, the outbound AI growth lead, or even the sales Jedi master.\n\nIn any case, whatever you want to call it, larger organizations are slowly waking up to the fact that there are countless benefits to leverage AI and technology for prospecting. AI models are getting better at a crazy pace. So take some time to look at what we can now. Just imagine what we'll be able to do in a couple of years.\n\nSo where to start? Right? Here's the issue. With over seven hundred plus AI sales tools and almost as many ways to leverage AI, it's difficult to know what to start with.\n\nThis is exactly what Timothy, Jeremy, Julio, Romain, Amme, and many others were going through when they first reached out to us at call like you. But they didn't just want someone to implement AI for them. What they wanted was to learn how to do it themselves so that they wouldn't need to rely on an external partner. If that's what you're looking to achieve, listen to what's next.\n\nSo look. The way most organizations leverage AI within sales is that they try to find a fancy tool that will do the personalization for them. The expectation is that their magic new AI gem will go through each prospect profile and find something relevant to say. You will then be able to send thousand messages at the press of a button without any effort, and the leads will start piling up.\n\nIf that's what you hope you'll get out of this, I'm sorry to disappoint you. It's not. To know how to best use AI, you need to first understand every single bottleneck in your current outbound process. So what does that mean?\n\nThis means that you need to learn how to make things work without AI to understand where it makes the most impact. Let me give you an example.\n\nAny great prospecting campaign starts with great targeting. So how do you target well? Right? You need to find companies suffering from a problem you can solve, which means that you need to have the understanding of what they are suffering from and the initiatives they are currently running.\n\nThink about what you do if you had unlimited time to research a person. You would probably be looking at their hiring patterns, how recently they were funded, are they already doing what you are selling them. Are they running ads, for example, if you sell advertising services? Did they post about needing a solution such as yours?\n\nWhat does their stack look like? Did a key employee just left the organization? Once you understand what you're looking for, you can have AI score a list of thousands of contact looking at this exact same information.\n\nThe whole idea is to be able to make as great research as you would if you had all the time in the world, but in this case, AI will do it for you. The result? You'll be able to research thousands as many prospects which means that your campaigns will be almost as good as if you had done the work manually but the difference is you can now do this at scale. But that's not just it.\n\nThere are plenty more ways to generate AI and tech within your workflows. For example, tools such as SensePark and Ubiqui send personalized videos, so you record a video once and then AI dynamically change your voice and background to send hundreds of personalized videos. You can automate your meeting note taking and have draft follow ups being written by tools like Attention. So no need to take minor loss anymore.\n\nYou can get coached in real time as you write your copy by tools like Twain. Twain would recommend ways to get your message across in a more powerful way and explain you why it suggests what it suggests.\n\nSmaller sent will help you improve your domain reputation by doing email warm up. It will help you categorize your replies. So once you get a reply from a prospect, their AI will just look at the sentiment of the reply, tell you if it's negative, positive, and you even have tools like Qiliving AI and Scheduler that lets you build bots that will reply on your behalf when prospect asks you questions.\n\nTools like Keyclay's AI agent will do prospect research on your behalf, and it will then personalize your outreach through their OpenAI and CloudAI integration based on the research you've made. You have lookalike company search done with ocean dot io. So you have a set of accounts that you had great results for, and then they're Android. We just recommend some very similar ones.\n\nAnd with Telescope, you can push your logic even further where you ask companies eleven to fifty. Telescope would give you a list, then you would teach the algorithm by telling the telescope this leads fits, this leads doesn't, and then you would get some custom recommendation. So you guessed it. There are countless of use cases, and the list is increasingly growing.\n\nNow we don't want to teach you AI sales tools for the sake of it. We'll teach you real world applications and workflows that we tried across hundreds of campaigns and experiments, failures, and success, you know, the ones we now deploy daily for our clients. The goal is not to be fancy. The goal is to be effective.\n\nI could go on and on and on and on, but I guess the best way to explain what you'll be able to do once you are done with the program might simply be to show you. So there are a few videos on our website that showcase step by step walkthroughs of the kind of campaigns you'll be able to build, replicate, but most importantly, recreate in your own style based on the problems of your prospects. So what does the program look like? You should get step by step tour videos to learn exactly how you run campaign and we've done for over seventy five clients.\n\nOne on one onboarding where we help you prioritize the missing gaps in the workflows you are trying to build. Weekly live sessions where we answer all your questions and build campaigns from scratch, live along with you, a Slack community where we share every last update as we will continually improve the program and in which we answer all your questions. But that's not it. You also get our complete set of SOPs on inbox management, client result reporting, client notifications, the internal automations we have built for our agencies for bond suite management, auto lead validation, performance monitoring, CRM integrations, or to better storage.\n\nYou will get our best converting cold email templates, scripts, and frameworks, and you'll get to copy paste the best clay workflows we used that generated thousands of leads for our clients.\n\nLast but not least, you will also get a list of AI prompts we used to personalize our outreach and to power our account research, plus access to the exact sales stack refund for clients as well as special deals with the best tools on the market.\n\nIf that sounds good to you and you want to know how to get started or get answers to any questions you may have, feel free to book a call with our team. See you there. See you soon. Bye bye.
